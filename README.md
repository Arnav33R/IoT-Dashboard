# IoT Web-App Dashboard

IoT Dashboard created for Dr. Moghimi at UC Davis.

## Introduction

- The overall goal of the project is to develop a smart pot, acting as a small-scale controlled environment system for a plant to detect various environmental factors and make decisions toachieve a desired environment for the plant to grow.

- The IoT system in use includes temperature, relative humidity, PAR and soil moisture sensors. It also includes a servo motor, an irrigation pummp, an LED, and a lamp as actuators. 

- This is the dashboard for the IoT system, which communicates with the microcontroller and collects sensor data, displaying it to the users. Users can also interact with the dashboard to trigger actuators based on set parameter values and thresholds.
